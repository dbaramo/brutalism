            <p>Brutalism is a style of architecture that lasted from the 1950s-1970s, 
            and it was characterized by simple, block-like, hulking concrete structures. 
            It originated in England and spread to the rest of the world shortly after.
            The term Brutalism—coined by Swedish architect Hans Asplund as "nybrutalism" 
            and popularized by British architectural critic Reyner Banham in 1955—is not a reference 
            to the arguably brutal nature of its appearance but a play on the French phrase for raw concrete, 
            "béton brut."
